# 🌿Whispers of Machine – Poetic LSTM Generator
## 📝 Overview
Whispers of Machine is a deep learning-based poetry generation project that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to generate poems inspired by classical and modern poets. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of poems, including Shakespearean works, to produce stylistically rich and coherent verses.

### 🎯 Features
📖 Poem Generation: Generates verses with thematic and stylistic coherence.
🤖 LSTM-Based Model: Trained using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM cells for sequential text prediction.
🎭 Shakespearean & Modern Styles: The model can imitate different poetic styles based on training data.
🔄 Fine-tunable: Users can retrain the model with custom poetry datasets.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
TensorFlow/Keras 🔬
BeautifulSoup 🧑‍💻 
NumPy & Pandas 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈 (for visualization)

### 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of:

🏛️ Shakespearean Sonnets 📜
📝 Modern Poems
📚 Additional classic poetry for diversity

### Preprocessing includes:

Tokenization & vectorization of text
Sequence padding for consistent input length
Character-level and word-level embeddings

### ⚡ Fun Fact
The first generated poem was so abstract, I thought the model had discovered Zen poetry! 😆
